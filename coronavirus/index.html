<h2 id="storage-requirements">Your responsibilities</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>You are required to wear a mask, covering your mouth and nose, at all times unless you are seated at a specifically marked workstation. If you leave your seat for any reason you must wear a mask.</li>
		<li>You must <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=QCm1Zbb0vUGDPTAz7Lz24XBEIlkbWfJPkQOqMOha7ypUMUNaSkRITlVWM0dNMDFZS0wxQzVSRE4xVC4u">"check in" to your workstation</a> The link is above.</li>
		<li>You must inform a member of staff when you are leaving so that they can clean your workstation ready for the next person.</li>
		<li>At all times you will comply with University Coronavirus regulations, including social distancing requirements.</li>
		<li>If you are exempt from wearing a mask you are strongly advised to wear the sunflower badge available from the <a href="https://testlivesalfordac.sharepoint.com/sites/UoS_Staff/SitePages/Return-to-Campus--what-you-need-to-know.aspx">AskUS in University House, your school office or MCUK reception</a>.</li>
		<li>Clean your hands with hand sanitiser before entering the space and regularly throughout, especially before and after you touch communal equipment or supplies.</li>
	</ul>

<h2 id="ppe">Our responsibilities</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We will clean workstations and machines between users using cleaners provided by the University, to the best of our ability.</li>
		<li>You will be provided with a keyboard and mouse that has spent time in quarantine.</li>
		<li>We will provide you with hand tools and clean them when they are returned. Ask a member of staff.</li>
	</ul>
<h2 id="capacity">Capacity</h2>
<p>The capacity of the Maker Space has been reduced. There are eight PCs available for CAD use, and five general purpose workstations. There is one laser cutting workstation and one electronics/soldering workstation.</p>
<p>If there is not a workstation available you may be asked to return later. It is not possible to "book" workstations in advance, they are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<h2 id="kitchen">Kitchen &amp; Print Hive are off-limits</h2>
	<p>Sadly the Kitchen and Print Hive are not for use by staff and students. However the water cooler is available for staff & students using your own bottle. If you need to 3D print a design file please follow the instructions below.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>Most of the tools are stored to prevent accidental contamination. If you wish to use hand tools please ask a member of staff to get them for you.</p>
<p>Once you are finished using your tools please place them carefully in the "USED TOOLS" box. Tools in this box will be periodically cleaned by staff and returned to storage for the next person.</p>
<p>Try and request all the tools you will need in one go - don't ask for them one at a time!</p>
</hr />
<h2 id="how-to-3d">How to 3D print</h2>
	<p>The Print Hive is only accessible to Maker Space staff. We're working on an online form for you to fill in, but in the meantime please email us - <a href="mailto:makerspace@salford.ac.uk?subject=3D%20Print%20Request&body=Description:%0D%0A%0D%0ANumber%20of%20copies:%0D%0A%0D%0APreferred%20colour:%0D%0A%0D%0ASpecial%20requirements:%0D%0A%0D%0A">makerspace@salford.ac.uk</a> - with the STL files as an attachment with all details listed below. If you wish to set your print up ready to go you can send us the gcode file or CURA project as well.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Description</strong> - Give a brief description of your prints so we know what we are looking at. Is this an engineering part to test fitment, or is it an aesthetic piece for your art project?</li>
		<li><strong>Number of copies</strong> - If you need more than one of each file let us know, with filenames. We will print one of each file otherwise. </li>
		<li><strong>Preferred colour</strong> - We will do our best, but no guarantees.</li>
		<li><strong>Special requirements</strong> - Do you need your file to be oriented a particular way, or specifically with or without supports? Need a specific material?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We will do our best to arrange printing in specific colours but material shortages from our supplier may mean that you receive a print in a different colour than expected.</p>
	<p>We'll get your print running as soon as machine availability allows and emaiil you back with an estimated finish time. Your prints will be sealed inside plastic bags and set aside until you can pick them up. We have limited space to store prints, so if they haven't been picked up within one month (circumstances allowing) they will be recycled.</p>
<h2 id="laser-cutting">How to laser cut</h2>
	<p>The laser cutters are freely available for use. Log your workspace use using the form linked above and get started. Ask a member of staff for use of stock material.</p>
	<p>Unless you are exempt you must wear a mask when using the laser cutters.</p>
	<p>If you haven't used the laser cutter before we can train you on its use. Speak to a member of the team for instructions.</p>
